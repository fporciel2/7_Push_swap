* Push_swap is a versatile sorting algorithm visualization tool. Designed as
*  a part of a programming challenge, they demonstrate the efficiency of
*  different sorting algorithms by visually displaying their operations.
*  The Push_swap and Checker programs are designed to work together for
*  sorting integers using a set of specific instructions while visualizing the
*  sorting process. Push_swap generates a sequence of instructions to sort a
*  list of numbers, and Checker verifies whether these instructions are valid
*  and successfully sort the list.
